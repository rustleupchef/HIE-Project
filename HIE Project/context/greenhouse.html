<h1>Green House Gases</h1>
<h2>The burning of fossil fuels causes many greenhouse gasses to be released into the world. This causes ocean acidification, air pollution, and global warming.</h2>
<div>I wonâ€™t be going in depth on the specific effects of fossil fuels, but I want to get across the main idea that fossil fuels cause many issues, and are actually inefficient.</div>
<br>
<div>Despite what I said I will quickly dicuss how greenhouse gases work. Greenhouse gases are gases that go into the atmosphere. These gases trap sunlight at earth which causes the overall warming of earth. These gases are also not good for our lungs, and the 2 things that stop it from affecting us our trees and the ocean. I want to focus on the ocean for a bit. The ocean takes most of our Co2, but the issue is that many key species that are nesscary for the surival of all species like autotrophs and coral are being affected by it. In more specific terms the smaller species are more affected by it.</div>
<br>
<div>The only upside is that they are very cheap. The other solution I have in mind might be cost more at the start, but will be more efficient and inexpensive in the long run</div>
<br>
<div>This reason why this matters is because fossil fuels are the #1 producer of greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses are the #1 reason for climate change.</div>
