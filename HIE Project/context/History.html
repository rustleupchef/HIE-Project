<h1>History of Fossil Fuels</h1>
<h2>The burning of fossil fuels started during the 1800s when it was used to heat homes, but the charging point was when we found out how to use it in factories because that was what powered the steam engine</h2>
<div>After this point it was used everywhere, people didn’t know it polluted our environment.</div>
<br>
<div>This caused the overuse of the product since it was more efficient than any other type of factory we had.</div>
<br>
<div>We only developed other solutions around the time it became a worldwide issue as it was used everywhere.</div>
<h2>The problem was that the solutions we made were good, but no matter how good they were there were multiple problems with switching</h2>
<div>The first issue was that our economy was based on fossil fuels, so we would have a lot of companies going bankrupt if we switched</div>
<br>
<div>Many of the other solutions are to expensive </div>
<br>
<div>Many companies are paying money to keep climate change and other issues under cover, so they can keep making money.</div>
<br>
<div>Some of these renewable energy sources are actually unreliable because they require a factor of our earth that isn’t always there like sunlight, wind, and water. Since these factors aren’t always there, we can’t rely on them, so switching becomes much harder.</div>
